## Web application to update mobile app information
Web application developed in **Apps Script** that receives the message sent by **TTN** (*The Things Network*), which includes the information 
sent by a vehicle detection device. This app processes
the message and gets the desired data, the current weather at the device location using the **OpenWeatherMap** API and updates the
information in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. 

The application developed in **AppSheet** will get the information from this spreadsheet to
represent it.
